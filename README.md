# A (very) simple file compressor

Hi, this is an example of a file compressor I wrote for school... a while ago.

It uses the Huffman algorithm.

I don't have time to maintaint the project, but the code might be useful for someone.

The comments are in French, and code has doxygen-compatible comments.




# How to use ?

Well, compile and run tests:

	chmod +x tester.sh
	./tester.sh
